# To-do List App

A very simple to-do app.

## Outstanding tasks:

- Sort out local storage so that a user's todos are cached
- Format dates correctly rather than just using strings
- Add sort functionality (by priority, name, due date)
- Add filter functionality (by project)
- Make priority into a check list with options rather than string entry
- Display warning message in red when someone tries to submit an entry without a title
- Prevent users opening multiple add new and edit boxes at the same time
- Allow escape and click away to exit an add new or details box
- Make the pop-out boxes into transitions
